My solution to React tutorial Tic Tac Toe game improvement exercises at https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#wrapping-up

Here are some improvements that I made to the tic-tac-toe game which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:

1. - [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
1. - [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list and grid.
1. - [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
1. - [x] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
1. - [x] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
1. - [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
